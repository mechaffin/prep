1.  How do you typically handle yourself in a fast-paced environment?

	I'm going to answer this with a question. What does your company/team mean by a "fast-paced envrionment"? 
	Do you mean that you have a well designed system and do a well planned release every 2 weeks? 
	Or do you mean that shortcuts are being taken for the sake of some arbitrary schedule and so you're always scrambling?



2.  How would you describe your work pace: fast, moderate, slow, or if it varies and under what circumstances?

	It varies. Depends on the tasks at hand. 
	Design tasks may appear to be slow going, but that's likely because there's a lot of thinking going on. 
	Implementation tasks are usually at a pretty moderate pace. Going too fast results in bugs, overlooking edge cases, and such.



3.  What are your strengths? Why?

	Experience based intuition. I often "know" a solution very quickly. Its usually right or a long way down the path to being right.
	Then, I have to figure out how to justify that solution to my team. Usually, this involves providing anecdotal evidence, 
	drawing on whiteboards, looking up resources, and sometimes prototyping.



4.  What are your weaknesses? Why?

	Wearing my heart on my sleeve. You'll generally know how I feel about a project, solution, or whatever is going on. 
	I sometimes have a hard time hiding frustrations.



5.  How do you handle a heavy workload with many deadlines?

	Prioritization and setting expectations.



6.  In all jobs there are heavy periods and light periods. What do you do in such cases?

	Appreciate the down times. They sometimes don't come often enough. 
	Take advantage of the time to ramp up on anything new that you'll need for upcoming projects, perhaps focus on some team building.
	



7.  You are given several rush projects to be completed in a short period of time. How would you establish priorities? Why?

	Using Eisenhower's Urgent/Important Principle. Work on Important tasks vs. not important ones. Urgent vs. not urgent ones.  
	So priorities would be:
	1. Important and Urgent tasks
	2. Important and Not Urgent tasks (hopefully, most of our time is spent here)
	3. Not Important, but Urgent tasks
	4. Not Important and Not Urgent tasks (in a work environment, these are unlikely to ever be completed)
	
	An exception to this guideline would be if there is some task that I can do relatively quickly to unblock someone else. 
	Those tasks are often not important to my success and should fall lower in priority, but they may be or contribute toward 
	something important to the team's success and so I would bump them up.



8.  How would you describe your organizational abilities?

	I am a PM in developer's clothing.



9.  How would you describe your attendance and punctuality habits?How would you describe your work habits? How would you describe your own performance standards?

	I have high standards for myself. 
	I loathe duplication of effort (or code); therefore, I strive for good design to reduce duplication and increase readability.

	Side note: 
		Attendance and punctuality? Really? Are these questions you would ask a senior engineer?  
		If you don't show up for work and/or don't get to meetings on time, you aren't going to last anywhere.
